About me

I am a Software Engineer at CognifAI, specializing in front-end development with a strong focus on Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, and React.js. My expertise extends to the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), which I mastered during my studies in Diploma in Computer Engineering.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning LlamaIndex and OpenAI technologies, delving into the cutting-edge advancements in AI and machine learning.

I’m always open to connecting with fellow professionals and exploring new opportunities. Let’s connect and grow together in the exciting world of technology!
